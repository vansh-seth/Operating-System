# Understanding Shortest Job First (SJF) Scheduling

In contrast to the First Come First Serve (FCFS) scheduling algorithm, which prioritizes processes based on their arrival time, the Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling algorithm arranges processes according to their burst time.

SJF scheduling selects the process with the shortest burst time from the pool of available processes in the ready queue for execution.

However, accurately predicting the burst time required for a process poses a significant challenge, making SJF implementation complex within a system.

## Advantages of SJF

- Maximizes throughput by prioritizing short processes.
- Minimizes average waiting and turnaround time by executing shorter processes first.

## Disadvantages of SJF

- May encounter starvation issues, where long processes are continually postponed in favor of shorter ones.
- Implementation complexity arises due to the unpredictable nature of burst times for processes.

While SJF offers advantages such as increased throughput and reduced waiting times, its susceptibility to starvation and the difficulty in accurately determining burst times limit its practical implementation in systems.
