## Implement the following:

- Q1. Consider the following code segment : int main (void) { for (int i=2; i<=5; i++) { fork( ); } printf (“GOCLASSES”); How many times “GOCLASSES” is printed by the above code?

- Q2. Int main () { fork(); printf("a"); fork(); printf("b"); return 0; } How many distinct outputs are possible of above code? And also give outputs

- Q3. For following code how many times the '*' will printed? main() { int i,n ; for(i = 1 ; i<=n ; ++i) { fork(); printf("*"); } }

- Q4. how many child process will be created for the following code.how many hello and welcome will be printed #include <stdio.h> void main() { fork(); fork(); printf("Hello \n"); fork(); printf("welcome\n"); }

- Q5. Consider the following piece of C code: void main( ) { fork( ); fork( ); exit( ); } How many child processes are created upon execution of this program?
