# Banker's Algorithm in Operating Systems

The Banker's Algorithm is a deadlock avoidance algorithm used in operating systems to allocate resources safely to processes. It ensures that the system will remain in a safe state after granting the requested resources. The algorithm is named because it resembles a bank's method of managing loan requests to avoid insolvency.

## Key Concepts

1. **S-State**: The algorithm checks all possible tests or activities before allocating resources to ensure that the system remains in a safe state.
2. **Deadlock Avoidance**: It helps the operating system avoid deadlocks by carefully managing resource allocation.
3. **Resource Management**: It ensures that the operating system can successfully share resources among processes without deadlock.

## Data Structures

- **Available**: An array of length `m` that defines each type of resource available.
- **Max**: An `n x m` matrix indicating the maximum number of resources each process may request.
- **Allocation**: An `n x m` matrix indicating the number of resources currently allocated to each process.
- **Need**: An `n x m` matrix indicating the remaining resources each process may need.

## Algorithms

### Safety Algorithm

This algorithm checks if the system is in a safe state.

1. Initialize `Work = Available` and `Finish[i] = false` for all `i`.
2. Find an index `i` such that:
   - `Finish[i] == false`
   - `Need[i] <= Work`
   If no such `i` exists, go to step 4.
3. If such an `i` is found,:
   - `Work = Work + Allocation[i]`
   - `Finish[i] = true`
   Repeat step 2.
4. If `Finish[i] == true` for all `i`, the system is in a safe state.

### Resource Request Algorithm

This algorithm handles resource requests from processes.

1. If `Request[i] <= Need[i]`, go to step 2. Otherwise, raise an error as the process has exceeded its maximum claim.
2. If `Request[i] <= Available`, go to step 3. Otherwise, the process must wait as resources are not available.
3. Allocate the requested resources:
   - `Available = Available - Request`
   - `Allocation[i] = Allocation[i] + Request[i]`
   - `Need[i] = Need[i] - Request[i]`
4. Check if the new state is safe using the Safety Algorithm. If the state is unsafe, rollback the allocation and make the process wait.

## Example

Consider a system with 5 processes (P1 to P5) and 3 resource types (A, B, C). The total resources are: A=10, B=5, C=7.

### Given Matrices

| Process | Allocation (A, B, C) | Max (A, B, C) |
|---------|----------------------|---------------|
| P1      | 0, 1, 0              | 7, 5, 3       |
| P2      | 2, 0, 0              | 3, 2, 2       |
| P3      | 3, 0, 2              | 9, 0, 2       |
| P4      | 2, 1, 1              | 2, 2, 2       |
| P5      | 0, 0, 2              | 4, 3, 3       |

### Available Resources

| A | B | C |
|---|---|---|
| 3 | 3 | 2 |

### Need Matrix Calculation

```
Need[i][j] = Max[i][j] - Allocation[i][j]

Need for P1: (7, 5, 3) - (0, 1, 0) = (7, 4, 3)
Need for P2: (3, 2, 2) - (2, 0, 0) = (1, 2, 2)
Need for P3: (9, 0, 2) - (3, 0, 2) = (6, 0, 0)
Need for P4: (2, 2, 2) - (2, 1, 1) = (0, 1, 1)
Need for P5: (4, 3, 3) - (0, 0, 2) = (4, 3, 1)
```

| Process | Need (A, B, C) |
|---------|----------------|
| P1      | 7, 4, 3        |
| P2      | 1, 2, 2        |
| P3      | 6, 0, 0        |
| P4      | 0, 1, 1        |
| P5      | 4, 3, 1        |

### Safety Check

1. **P1**: Need > Available (7, 4, 3 > 3, 3, 2) → Not Safe
2. **P2**: Need <= Available (1, 2, 2 <= 3, 3, 2) → Safe
   - New Available = (5, 3, 2)
3. **P3**: Need > Available (6, 0, 0 > 5, 3, 2) → Not Safe
4. **P4**: Need <= Available (0, 1, 1 <= 5, 3, 2) → Safe
   - New Available = (7, 4, 3)
5. **P5**: Need <= Available (4, 3, 1 <= 7, 4, 3) → Safe
   - New Available = (7, 4, 5)
6. **P1**: Need <= Available (7, 4, 3 <= 7, 4, 5) → Safe
   - New Available = (7, 5, 5)
7. **P3**: Need <= Available (6, 0, 0 <= 7, 5, 5) → Safe
   - New Available = (10, 5, 7)

### Safe Sequence

The safe sequence is P2, P4, P5, P1, P3.

### Resource Request Example

If P1 requests (1, 0, 0):
- Request <= Need (1, 0, 0 <= 7, 4, 3) → True
- Request <= Available (1, 0, 0 <= 3, 3, 2) → True
- Allocate resources:
  - Available = (2, 3, 2)
  - Allocation for P1 = (1, 1, 0)
  - Need for P1 = (6, 4, 3)
- Check new state safety → Safe
- Request granted.

## Conclusion

The Banker's Algorithm is essential for managing resources in an operating system to avoid deadlocks. By following the safety and resource request algorithms, the system ensures safe allocation of resources to processes.
