# Priority Scheduling Algorithm: Preemptive vs Non-Preemptive

## What is Priority Scheduling?

Priority Scheduling is a method of managing processes based on their priority levels. In this algorithm, tasks are selected for execution according to their assigned priority, ensuring that higher priority tasks are processed before lower priority ones. Priority can be determined by various factors such as memory requirements and time constraints.

## Types of Priority Scheduling

### Preemptive Scheduling

In Preemptive Scheduling, tasks are assigned priorities, and higher priority tasks can interrupt the execution of lower priority tasks. This allows for immediate execution of high priority tasks, improving responsiveness.

### Non-Preemptive Scheduling

Non-Preemptive Scheduling allocates the CPU to a specific process until it completes or voluntarily releases the CPU. This method doesn't interrupt the execution of tasks, making it simpler and suitable for various hardware platforms.

## Characteristics of Priority Scheduling

- Prioritizes tasks based on their assigned priority levels.
- Used in operating systems for batch processing.
- Utilizes a numeric priority value for each process.
- Lower priority values indicate higher priority.
- Preempts lower priority tasks if a higher priority task becomes available.
- Can operate on a First Come, First Served (FCFS) basis for tasks with equal priorities.

## Example of Priority Scheduling

Consider the following example with processes P1 to P5:

| Process | Priority | Burst Time | Arrival Time |
|---------|----------|------------|--------------|
| P1      | 1        | 4          | 0            |
| P2      | 2        | 3          | 0            |
| P3      | 1        | 7          | 6            |
| P4      | 3        | 4          | 11           |
| P5      | 2        | 2          | 12           |

## Advantages of Priority Scheduling

- Simple and easy to use.
- Provides faster execution for high priority tasks.
- Allows precise definition of task importance.
- Suitable for applications with varying resource requirements.

## Disadvantages of Priority Scheduling

- Low priority tasks may suffer if high priority tasks consume too much CPU time.
- Low priority tasks may be postponed indefinitely, leading to potential starvation.
- Risk of system crashes causing loss of low priority processes.
- Potential for waiting indefinitely if high priority tasks continuously join the ready queue.
